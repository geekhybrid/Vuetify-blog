# Story book for Visual Testing

<p> It wasn't absolutely necessary for a project of this size, but merely a demonstration of how I prefer to document my components when collaborating with designers and product managers. Storybook is a good designer-developer documentation and testing tool.</p>

<h3>One sentence for why I used Storybook</h3>
<p>The whole app/page doesn't need to be ready to understand how distinct components will look, feel and work.</p>

# Screaming Architecture
<p>Screaming architecture is a style of organising files that allow the intent of the app to be visible at a high level. 
I have introduced non-standard-vue-project folders like features and arranged contents in them to immediately hint at what the app is about.</p>

<br/>
<p>Some frameworks benefit from conventions such as directory naming e.g '/components', '/layouts', '/pages', '/store', '/router', '/plugins etc. 
While screaming Architecture goes a step further by making the intent of the app visible at a high level, it might be a bit "different" or "strange" for people who are used to working
with conventional scaffolding.</p>

<h3>Also I have chosen to keep related files together. This adheres to principle of proximity. So while this is not also very conventional, I have found it helpful in the past for very large projects.</h3>
